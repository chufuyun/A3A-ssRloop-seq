# A3A-ssRloop-seq

## A3A deamination-assisted Rloop DNA sequencing approach (A3A-Rloop-seq) leverages the chemical reactivity of the displaced ssDNA strand under non-denaturing conditions, with A3A serving as a readout for characterizing ssDNA and excluding the same region after RNaseH1 treatment. A3A-Rloop-seq offers the advantage of generating strand-specific R-loops with a nearly single-base resolution.
